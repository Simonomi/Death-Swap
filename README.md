# Death swap
A minecraft datapack for the game death swap

### How to install
1. Copy the zip file (releases) to _.minecraft/saves/**world name**/datapacks_
2. In the world, type _/reload_ to (re)start the game

### How to play
Try to kill the other player by any (ingame) means necessary, both players start thousands of blocks apart and randomly swap positions after a random amount of time.

### Notes
* Make sure there are 2 players in the world to play
* This is intended for 1.15

### Future plans
1. Make "spectator mode" for 3+ player games
2. Possibly cycle swapping with 3+ players
